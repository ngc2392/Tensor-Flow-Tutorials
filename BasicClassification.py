#This guide uses the Fashion MNIST dataset https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist
# We will use 60,000 images to train the network and 10,000 images to evaluate how accurately the network learned to classify images.  You can access the Fashion MNIST directly from TensorFlow, just import and load the data.

"""
Loading the dataset returns four NumPy arrays: (returns 2 tuples)

	train_images and train_labels arrays are the 'training set' - the data the model uses to learn

	The model is tested against the 'test set', the test_images and test_labels array

	The images are 28x28 NumPy arrays, with pixel values ranging from between 0 and 255. The 'labels' are an array of integers, ranging from 0 to 9 

	Each image is mapped to a single label
